My journey with coding has come a long way from when I first started in the summer of 2020. It came at a time when I was extremely bored, and didn't have anything else to do. Through sheer boredom, I was able to teach myself how to code and make websites. I learnt a ton about creating things through the whole experience. Hopefully through these experiences you can see what I learned.

## My First Website

In the summer of 2020, I was extremely bored. I had finished school and wasn't doing anything over the summer. Every day, I would go outside and experience the same chilly but fresh air of the Netherlands. Because of covid, my friends and I had been playing video games all throughout the school year. However, I didn't want to spend my summer gaming even **more**.

In the past, I had heard Javascript, Python, and making websites. I knew it was something I wanted to do. However, I hadn't gotten around to teaching myself it. I always thought programming was an extremely difficult thing to do, and I never made time to learn all the basics. Around that time, my friend called Alfio had been creating an interactive chat website called "lemonchat." After digging around the code for his website, I got inspired to start my own. I didn't know anything about coding or starting a website. I just bought a domain name for $10, rented a server for $5, and told myself I'd figure it out.

And I did! By the end of the summer, I had figured out enough about coding to create a website and also host it on my server. It was such a great experience being able to navigate to "nevin.cc" on my phone and *see* the published version I had been working on. It was also nice to be able to know all the intricacies behind the website. For example, knowing that when I navigated to "nevin.cc/files", exacatly *which* part of my code had run to serve my request.

This experience of creating my own website taught me I could make a very small change in the world through the things I taught myself. Nobody had told me to create the website, I just had something I wanted to do and figured it out.

## The Next Steps
After creating my personal website, I was ecstatic with ideas. Instead of just working on my own personal website, what if I created something which could benefit other people?

My friend Victor and I spent the next few months teaching ourselves how to code while making various websites we would release to people. Our first one, riggedcoinflip.com, allowed people to determine the outcome of a coin flip - before they flipped it. We learnt a ton about javascript and databases through this website, and it was an extremely difficult task. However, the stories people submitted through out "contact" page made the effort all worth it.

As the year came to an end, my friend and I decided to make GuessThePrice.net, a fun game where you guessed the price of various amazon items. It was the biggest project we attempted in a while. After releasing this website, we saw people playing it on podcasts which got a hundred thousand views, and even almost started working with a Tik Tok creator.

Once again, this experience taught me I could make a very ***real*** change in the world through the things I created.

## Present Day

These days, I'm still coding things and learning new topics. The summer day of learning how to code was the reason I majored in computer science.

Conclusion

- talk about ftn readable all that stuff

- talk about how this website inspired you to create many other websites, and that''l be taht


And I did! After a few weeks, I taught myself enough code to set up a basic website (seen below), and configure a basic server to host it on. It was extremely difficult, and a ton of work. However, since I had a lot of free time, I was able to finish what I set out to do.

- we were so bored we decided to teach ourselves how to code
- by the end of the summer we ended up coding the website
- we released it and dint' expect much
- we were really excited when people started using it


2. guesstheprice.net
- we first tried creating it, but learned how to fail and get back up again
- seeing youtubers play the game and play it on a podcast, millionshenry, simplypodlogical.


3. readable.so
- we learned how to actually solve a problem and help people instead of just making fun stuff
- tons of work and learnta lot
- taught me what i watned to do for the rest of my life


conclusion: restate rigged etc
