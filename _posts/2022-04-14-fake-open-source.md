I had found this pretty cool open source project called BeamMP - a multiplayer mod for Beamng Drive. I thought the idea was pretty cool. BeamNG drive is a singleplayer only game, so for modders to have ported over multiplayer functionality is impressive.

I was looking at the code, seeing if I could modify it and play around with it - and then I looked at the license.

```
Custom ISC License

and this permission notice appear in all copies.
```

Wtf?? Permission to use as long as the work is committed to the master branch? Who does this help besides the creators? Why is there any incentive for anyone contribute if they can't even benefit from the changes?

Fine. Maybe the authors want to protect their work. But I don't understand why one takes an aggressive stance when developing something like this. It's a cool idea, but the licenses make it feel like the developers are doing this for themselves more than they are the community around it.

I also looked at the clients/servers, and they aren't even released under this license. You are able to view the source code, but they're closed source. Why?? What if someone wanted to make a change to a server (modding support)?

Not only that, if you want to start a server, you need a key which you can only get from the repository owners, meaning if they don't like you, they can just ban your server.

In my opinion this needs to be free and decentralized or it will fail. There's no reason a project which breaks boundaries should be tied off to a few people.
